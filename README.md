# Freelance-Flight-Project
A open source Unity Package allowing anyone to import a robust and well developed example of an arcade flight game utilising a control scheme similar to Freelancer(2003), including quality 3D assets in addition to detailed script documentation to give newcomers a good insight into Unity development practices and how the various components of the package work together.

Credit to Why485 for allowing me to build on his own work, in particular, the Ship Physics and Camera system, and share my own updated version. The purpose of this project is to share, help and inspire others to build similar works in this genre.
